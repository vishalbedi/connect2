# Connect-2

An angular based application that uses WebRTC to perform video chat between two browsers across the internet. 
To perform end to end communications we use public STUN and TURN servers hosted by google. 
WebRTC uses peer-to-peer protocol for communication. 

The application should always be accessed using https url as webrtc requires ssl.
